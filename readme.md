Hello,

This is a basic YouTube streaming thing for the Cardputer. It only supports searching for video titles and picking the first result right now.

You need to run the client on the Cardputer and the server on your computer.

The server is taken from a similar project here: https://github.com/atomic14/esp32-tv

But modified to download YouTube videos with yt-dlp.

You will need to build the .bin file yourself and input your wifi/ip information for it to work properly.
